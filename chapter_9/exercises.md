# Exercises

**9-0.** Compile, execute, and test the programs in this chapter.

**9-1.** Reimplement the `Student_info` class so that it calculates the final 
grade when reading the student's record, and stores that grade in the object.
Reimplement the `grade` function to use this precomputed value.

**9-2.** If we define the `name` function as a plain, non`const` member function,
what other functions in our system must change and why?

**9-3.** Our `grade` function was written to throw an exception if a user tried 
to calculate a grade for a `Student_info` object whose values had not yet been
read. Users who care are expected to catch this exception. Write a program that
triggers the exception by does not catch it. Write a program that catches the
exception.

**9-4.** Rewrite your program from the previous exercise to use the `valid` 
function, thereby avoiding the exception altogether.

**9-5.** Write a class and associated functions to generate grades who take the
course for pass/fail credit. Assume that only the midterm and final grades
matter, and that a student passes with a average exam score greater than 60.
The report should list the students in alphabetical order, and indicate `P` or
`F` as the grade.

**9-6.** Rewrite the grading program for the pass/fail students so that the
report shows all the students who passed, followed by all the students who
failed.

**9-7.** The `read_hw` function 4.1.3/57 solves the general problem (reading a
sentence of values into a `vector`) even though its name suggests that it
should be part of the implementation of `Student_info`. Of course, we could
change its name--but suppose, instead, that you wanted to integrate it with the
rest of the `Student_info` code, in order to clarify that it was not intended
for public access despite its apparent generality. How would you do so?
